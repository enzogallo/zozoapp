# Zozo App

Welcome to the Zozo App, a personal iOS project I started in September 2024. This app is part of my journey to explore and enhance my skills in Swift/SwiftUI and go further in iOS development. With 3 years of experience as a developer, I am now taking on the challenge of building my own app with a simple but meaningful objective: helping me track my football match history and create formations for pre-match planning.

Beyond this initial goal, I also aim to integrate backend implementation into the app, allowing me to better understand how server-side functionalities work and gain insights that will enhance my role as a frontend developer.

Project Goals :

Learn and experiment: Build expertise in Swift and SwiftUI by tackling practical challenges.
Create useful features: Develop tools that align with my personal interests, such as football match tracking and team management.
Explore iOS development concepts: Dive into modern app design, state management, animations, and more.
Expand my horizons: Use backend integration to learn how frontend and backend systems interact seamlessly.

Current Features :

Match History Tracking
A simple, intuitive interface to log and track football matches.
Record essential details such as team names, scores, dates, and more.

Formation Creator
A pre-match planning tool to design and visualize football team formations.
Drag-and-drop interactions for arranging players on the field (planned improvement).

Modern SwiftUI Design
Declarative UI: Designed entirely in SwiftUI, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.
State Management: Leveraging tools like @State and @Binding to manage the app's data flow seamlessly.


Planned Improvements :

Enhanced Formation Tool: Add interactive gestures and customizable player profiles.
Database Integration: Implement persistent storage using Core Data or JSON for saving match histories and formations.
Statistics Dashboard: Include analytics for match stats, team performance, or player contributions.
Polished UI: Enhance animations, field visuals, and accessibility for a professional-grade experience.

Future Vision :

While this app currently focuses on football, I envision it evolving to reflect all of my passions, including music and travel.

Music: Adding features to create playlists, track favorite songs, or integrate with streaming platforms.
Travel: Incorporating travel logs, itineraries, or interactive maps for personal adventures.
This evolution will make the app not just a tool, but a representation of who I am and what I love.

Technologies Used :

SwiftUI: For building declarative and responsive UIs.
Swift: For application logic and exploring new iOS development concepts.
Xcode: Primary development environment.

How to Run the Project ?

Clone or download this repository.
Open the .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file in Xcode (latest version recommended).
Select a simulator or connected device to run the app.
Click Run to build and launch the application.

What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far :

The power and flexibility of SwiftUI for creating dynamic, reusable UIs.
State and data flow management using SwiftUI's property wrappers.
The importance of designing modular code for scalability and maintenance.

Why This Project?

This app is my personal playground for learning iOS development while indulging my passions. It started as a simple idea and has grown into a versatile tool for tracking match histories and creating formations (for now ðŸ™‚). With each iteration, Iâ€™m not only building an app but also sharpening my development skills.

Future Outlook :

This app is just the beginning. I plan to continue evolving it by adding features, refining the design, and sharing it with others who might benefit from its functionality. Over time, I want the app to grow into something that uniquely represents meâ€”combining my love for football, music, and travel into one cohesive platform.

Thank you for checking out my project! Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome. ðŸ˜Š
